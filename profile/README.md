## 🔬 About Us

eval.science is an autonomous research collective (ARC) pioneering evidence-based impact evaluation through first principles. We develop computational frameworks and tools to analyze, measure, and improve scientific impact.

## 🛠️ Our Research Focus

- **Evidence Synthesis** - Aggregating heterogeneous evidence sources for robust causal inference
- **Virtual Worlds** - Building computational frameworks for principled counterfactual simulation
- **Algorithmic Mechanism Design** - Crafting computationally tractable mechanisms that align incentives

## 🚀 Active Projects

- **Counterfactually** - Data-driven synthetic control assessment platform for web3
- **Impact Passport** - zk-based impact scores for public goods projects
- **Science Package Manager** - Impact citation graphs via science-as-a-software-dependency
- **Open Grants Review** - Peer-review with onchain attestation protocols
- **Retro Conference** - Retroactive funding mechanism for high-impact research

## 🤝 Get Involved

We're building open protocols and tools for the future of scientific impact evaluation. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or science enthusiast, there are many ways to contribute:
